# pdfshrink
Reduced PDF filesize via command line, includes a number of options (based on ghostscript).

(This was based in this [old script of mine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PedroLopes/bashscripting/refs/heads/master/pdfshrink.sh), which was probbaly based on someone's answer on stackoverflow. The current version here includes some minor improvements, such as an install script and more options.)
